# Set

This will eventually be a web application of the game Set.  I hope to use it as a means of learning Elm, so right now, and for a good while, the project will likely consist of experimentations in Elm's "model-update-view" structure and getting used to the language -- all while trying to meander my way to an implementation that resembles the game Set.
